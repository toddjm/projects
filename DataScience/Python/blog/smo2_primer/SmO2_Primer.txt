What is SmO2 and Why Do We Care?

One of the most challenging and rewarding tasks we have
here at BSX Athletics is helping our customers use and
benefit from data colleted by their BSXinsight devices.

Presently, BSXinsight can be used to determined lactate
threshold (LT) and observe SmO2 as a function of time
during an assessment or a daily activity.

SmO2 is a measure of the balance of supply and demand of
blood oxygen in the muscle being monitored. For BSXinsight,
that's the calf muscle of either leg.

As the activity level increases, the muscle needs more oxygen
to generate power. And that oxygen is transported by blood.
