BSXinsight is a great tool for assessing your
lactate threshold (LT) and integrating muscle
oxygen (SmO2) into your training routines. But are
there other "markers" in the SmO2 data that can be
examined and utilized?

Can we look at muscle oxygen and heart rate (HR) for
an activity - not an assessment - and glean any useful
or actionable data? We examined HR and SmO2 for an
outdoor ride

Looking at the time lag between a dip in muscle oxygen and
spike in heart rate for these intervals (solid ver
