When you're looking at your muscle oxygen (SmO2) numbers for various
activities, you'll likely notice that the initial readings fluctuate
from day to day. For an assessment, a specific protocol is followed,
and trends in muscle oxygen are easier to follow and analyze for that
reason. But what about muscle oxygen levels recorded during
unstructured activities?

BSX Athletics team member Caldwell Shine commutes
to and from our offices by bicycle each day, and he collects heart
rate and muscle oxygen data along the way. We took muscle
oxygen values for 4 recent trips and plotted them as seen
in Figure 1.

We get a lot of questions concerning muscle oxygen levels, in
particular about the readings observed when BSXinsight is first
turned on. Those readings can and will vary for a variety
of reasons. The biggest contribution to initial muscle oxygen
variation is the amount of activity you've had before turning on
BSXinsight. If you've not moved around to get your blood flowing,
those intital readings will be a little lower than when you did
do some even light warmup or movement. In Figure 1, we see Caldwell's
muscle oxygen ranging from 67% to 73% at the outset of his rides.

During an unstructured activity, muscle oxygen levels will change 
as a function of exertion, fatigue, and other factors that are not
controlled (wind speed, elevation changes, and so on). The middle
of Caldwell's ride - 360 to 1080 seconds - shows some nice efforts,
including a climb on his route. Muscle oxygen changes trend the same
way but we still see a lot of fluctuation because the activity is
unstructured.

The final parts of Caldwell's rides exhibit wide variation in muscle
oxygen and illustrate how variables like traffic lights, wind direction,
and subject fatigue factor into muscle oxygen levels.
