# Human neuronal nicotine $\alpha_{7}$ model.

### Human NNR putative model.

### Human sequence hand-modified on snail backbone.

### CYX and HID residues are disulphide bridged cysteines and delta-protonated histidines, respectively. 

### XX moieties are calcium ions. EPE is HEPES. All waters are present.

### This structure was obtained by running 25 ps of MD at constant pressure and 300 K with periodic boundary conditions. 

### The resulting structure here is the energy-minimized structure after the MD run. 500 steps steepest descent + 1500 steps conjugate gradient.
