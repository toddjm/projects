<h2>Is there anything better than zfill?</h2>
<p>June 26, 2016 by <a href="#">Todd</a></p>

<p>I got interested in looking at some cycling and running data I have and needed
to write a piece of code to convert meters per second to minutes and seconds 
per mile. Here's what I came up with:

<pre><code>def ms_to_pace(speed):
    """Given m/s, return pace as minutes:seconds per mile."""
    min_per_mile = 26.8224 / speed
    minutes = int(min_per_mile)
    seconds = round(60 * (min_per_mile - minutes))
    return str(minutes) + ':' + str(seconds)
</code></pre>

<p>It seemed to work for a speed of 3.7 m/s, returning 7:15. But for a speed of 3.8 m/s,
I got 7:4 instead of 7:04. That's where the magic of zfill comes in. I revised the last
line in my function to read

<pre><code>return str(minutes) + ':' + str(seconds).zfill(2)</code></pre>

and now

<pre><code>ms_to_pace(3.8)
'7:04'
</code></pre>

<h2>Using Quandl's python module to look at SPY and VIX data</h2>
<p>June 21, 2016 by <a href="#">Todd</a></p>

<p>It's pretty straightforward to get daily open/high/low/close data from Quandl
and use pandas and numpy to get the data into one-dimensional arrays for analysis.
I use the
<a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads#_unix">Anaconda 3.5 python distro</a>
on a vanilla Ubuntu Linux platform and use Jupyter notebooks most of the time.

<p>First, you'll need to install the Quandl python module by running

<p><kbd>conda install Quandl</kbd></p>

on the command line. The imports I'll use for this post are:

<pre><code>import configobj
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import Quandl
%matplotlib inline
</code></pre>

<p>Next, get your authentication token from <a href="https://www.quandl.com">Quandl</a>.
I store mine in my home directory and use <code>configobj</code> to grab it:

<pre><code>config = configobj.ConfigObj('/home/todd/.authtoken_Quandl')
authtoken = config['authtoken']
</code></pre>

<p>One thing we might be interested in is predicting the change in price of
SPY today (today's close - today's open) from the change in price of VIX 
from yesterday's close to today's open (today's open - yesterday's close).

<p>We'll define our predictor as
$$VIX_{open}(t) - VIX_{close}(t-1)$$

and the target as

$$SPY_{close}(t) - SPY_{open}(t)$$

<p>This kind of analysis falls into the general category of rank and sign tests. We're
asking if the sign and magnitude of the predictor is statistically correlated with the
sign and magnitude of the target. Simply put: By looking at the open price of VIX today and
the close price of VIX yesterday, can we predict if the price of SPY at the end of today will be
less than or more than the open price? If so, we can place our bets and profit!

<p>We can grab daily price data from Quandl as follows:

<pre><code>SPY = Quandl.get("YAHOO/INDEX_SPY", authtoken=authtoken)  # Daily stock prices for SPY.
VIX = Quandl.get("CBOE/VIX", authtoken=authtoken)  # Daily stock prices for VIX.
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we should do is have a look at the sorted distributions of the predictor
and target, both sorted. The Jupyter notebook for what I've done here and the illustration
of those sorted distributions is <a href="VIX_SPY_Distributions.html">here</a>.
