## Objective
Your assignment is to explore a business's data to build a model that can predict the churn score of their users.

## Brief
A business wants to reduce its user churn and has hired you as an expert to help with this task. You are tasked with building a machine learning model that predicts the churn score of employees based on multiple features.

## Data
The dataset consists of user’s demographic data, membership details, duration and frequency of visits to the company’s website, user complaints and feedback, and historical purchase data.

The churn score is a prediction of how long a user will remain a customer and is updated daily for all users who have purchased any product/service. The values assigned are between 1 to 5.

NOTE: Some missing values are filled in with pre-determined values depending on the variable, be careful when exploring the data.

## Tasks
* Implement assignment using:
  * Language: Python
  * Libraries: any libraries

* Exploratory data analysis and data visualization
* Data preprocessing
* Feature engineering and feature selection
* Train/test split
* Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
  * Bonus: Explore using a deep learning model - it does not have to be your final model
* Use your chosen model to predict on the given test set
  * ```test.csv``` has no churn score variable so you cannot check your final accuracy

## Evaluation Criteria
* Python best practices
* Show us your work through your commit history
* Completeness: did you complete all of the necessary tasks?
* Explainability: is the code written in a sensible, thought-out way in easy to follow steps?
* Testing: is each step adequately tested and thought through?

## CodeSubmit
Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were being presented to a customer - then push your changes to the master branch. You can add as many files as you see fit, but only the attached python notebook file ```final_submission.ipynb``` will be reviewed. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

This is an online coding assignment, so you are allowed to access external references and resources. We will be checking for plagiarism and if you are found guilty of plagiarizing code, your application will be rejected immediately.

All the best and happy coding,
